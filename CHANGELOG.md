Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-06

### Changed
- Desktop UI: full redesign — quiet sans-serif aesthetic, click-driven sidebar
  (servers / channels / DMs), grouped messages with day separators and
  timestamps, right-side `IN CALL` peer panel with voice bars and fingerprints,
  large `CONNECTED` strip with mute / mode / leave controls
- Identicon: spiral phyllotaxis pattern derived from fingerprint
- Sidebar voice-activity wave (animated vertical bars) under speaking channels
- Private channels marked with subtle diagonal stripes
- Tweaks panel in Settings: theme, accent, density, typeface

### Added
- ⌘K palette replaces the old slash-command bar — channels, DMs, servers,
  free-form commands
- `@`-mention popover in the channel composer opens a DM with the picked peer
- Public channels auto-load on connect; sidebar refreshes after disconnect
- Self-rename safety net: client re-sends `SetName` if a channel join races
  ahead of name registration
- `name_changed` event now updates participants, speaker map and self status

### Fixed
- HMR no longer double-subscribes Tauri event listeners (was producing N×
  duplicate log lines after dev reloads)
